# Sebek78Nx

It's a simple CMS for stocks and the stock market. It is created in the Nx monorepo.

## New technologies to learn and practice for me:
- [Nx](https://nx.dev/) - build system with first class monorepo support 
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - TypeScript ORM
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) - asynchronous state management (via React Query)
- [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) - design methodology

## Other technologies:
- TypeScript
- Postgres
- Nest.js
- Passport.js
- React
- React Hook Form + Yup
- Styled Components
- Custom design system strongly based on [Primer](https://primer.style/) design (from Github) and MUI.
